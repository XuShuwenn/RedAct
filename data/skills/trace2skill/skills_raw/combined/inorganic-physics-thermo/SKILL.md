# Thermodynamics Equilibrium Calculation

## When to Use

- Calculate Gibbs free energy from enthalpy and entropy
- Compute equilibrium constant from ΔG
- Solve chemistry/thermodynamics problems

- Prefer a short script when the task requires exponentials, precise rounding, or strict output-file formatting.

## Input Format

File `/root/input.txt` (one per line):
- ΔH: Reaction enthalpy (kJ/mol)
- ΔS: Reaction entropy (J/mol·K)
- T: Temperature (K)

- Map lines by position exactly when `/root/input.txt` contains three numeric lines: line 1 = ΔH (kJ/mol), line 2 = ΔS (J/mol·K), line 3 = T (K).
- Parse the observed numeric values exactly as written, including negatives and scientific notation; do not reorder, relabel, infer, or guess inputs.
- Assign the three parsed values to variables and restate them with units before doing any math.
- If parsing fails or the values seem inconsistent, inspect the raw contents of `/root/input.txt` first and confirm it contains exactly three newline-separated values before retrying.

## Calculations

1. Convert ΔS to kJ/mol: ΔS(kJ) = ΔS(J) / 1000
2. Calculate ΔG: ΔG = ΔH - T × ΔS(kJ)
3. Calculate K: K = exp(-ΔG / (R × T))

- If using ΔG in kJ/mol inside the exponent, convert it to J/mol: `K = exp(-(ΔG * 1000) / (8.314 * T))`.
- DO NOT flip the sign in the exponent: `exp((ΔG * 1000) / (8.314 * T))` is wrong.
- Sanity-check the result: if ΔG < 0, then `K > 1`; if ΔG > 0, then `K < 1`.

   - R = 8.314 J/mol·K

- Before computing K, make units consistent: either convert ΔG from kJ/mol to J/mol, or use R = 0.008314 kJ/mol·K.
- Write the substituted arithmetic before finalizing: e.g., ΔS = 50 J/mol·K = 0.050 kJ/mol·K, so at T = 298 K, TΔS = 14.90 kJ/mol and ΔG = ΔH - TΔS = -100 - 14.90 = -114.90 kJ/mol.
- DO NOT change `ΔH - T×ΔS` into `ΔH + T×ΔS` unless ΔS itself is negative.

- Use this sequence consistently: read `ΔH`, `ΔS`, and `T` from `/root/input.txt` → compute raw values before formatting output → convert `ΔS` from J/mol·K to kJ/mol·K → compute `TΔS` → compute `ΔG = ΔH - TΔS` → use that same computed `ΔG` in the `K` formula → make the exponent units consistent → compute `K`.
- Before finalizing, substitute the actual observed numbers into each step to catch sign and unit mistakes.
- If `ΔS` is positive, subtract a positive `TΔS`; only a negative `ΔS` changes the sign of that term through substitution.
- For `K`, use one unambiguous unit-matched form: `-(ΔG*1000)/(8.314*T)` or equivalently `-ΔG/(0.008314*T)`; do not mix J and kJ choices within one calculation.
- Use a calculator or short script for the final `exp(...)` evaluation rather than mental arithmetic, especially when the exponent is large.
- After computing `K`, confirm the sanity check with the actual result: `ΔG < 0` must give `K > 1`, `ΔG > 0` must give `K < 1`, and `ΔG` near 0 should give `K` near 1.


## Output Format

To `/root/output.txt`:
```
ΔG: XX.XX kJ/mol
K: X.XXXXe+N
```

- Round ΔG to 2 decimal places
- Scientific notation for K (e.g., 1.23e+04)
- Format ΔG with exactly 2 digits after the decimal point, even when trailing zeros are needed (e.g., `-114.90`, not `-114.9`)
- Before finishing, read `/root/output.txt` and verify both lines match the required labels, units, decimal precision, and scientific notation

- Prefer programmatic formatting such as `ΔG` with `:.2f` and `K` with `:.4e`; do not rely on default numeric string conversion.
- Treat post-write verification as mandatory: after writing `/root/output.txt`, read it back and confirm there are exactly two lines in the required order: `ΔG` first, then `K`.
- Re-check character-for-character that the labels are exactly `ΔG:` and `K:`, the units are correct, `ΔG` has exactly 2 digits after the decimal point, `K` is in scientific notation, and there is no extra commentary.

## Tips

- Parse values from input file
- Handle scientific notation
- Check unit consistency (convert J to kJ properly)


- Read `/root/input.txt` and use only observed values; do not assume missing inputs.
- Verify the sign by substituting the actual numbers, not just the symbols.
- Before evaluating `exp(...)`, confirm ΔG and `R×T` use the same energy units.
- Treat formatting as part of correctness: if the computed value is `-114.9`, write `ΔG: -114.90 kJ/mol`
- Use the exact two-line output structure with no extra commentary in `/root/output.txt`

- Prefer a single short Python script or similarly reproducible workflow to read `/root/input.txt`, compute intermediate values explicitly, format both lines, write `/root/output.txt`, and read it back to verify formatting.
- Keep computation and presentation separate: finish the unit-consistent arithmetic before applying rounding or scientific-notation formatting.
- Do not calculate from guessed values; if a read fails or a value is missing, stop and retry the read rather than inventing inputs.
